#####As people struggle to survive through the mundane lockdown by the day, their last resort has become video streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney + Hotstar, etc. OTT (Over-the-Top) services have gained admiration among the masses during the nationwide lockdown and experience a swelling increase in consumption and subscriber count, giving a fierce competition to DTH providers. This ravenous demand for fresh content by viewers has put OTT platforms at war for eyeballs.

#####The biggest slice of cake in the Indian OTT market has been taken by Hotstar, followed by Amazon Prime and Netflix. With a whopping 41% of the market share, Hotstar has topped the charts with its freemium model and sports streaming. Platforms like Voot Select, JioTV, Zee5 are buckled up in line with their range of ammo for the battle. Due to this spike in viewership, online streaming services are forced to diversify and expand their features to keep the audience tied up.  It seems like the viewers are in for a treat.
