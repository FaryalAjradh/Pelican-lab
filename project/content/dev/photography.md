Summary: Here is the portfolio of the photos I captured this year!
#just another shutterbug
###With the quarantine blues getting on to me, I decided to pick up my DSLR and capture everything I found beauty in. With photography, I learnt that there's a story behind even the littlest of things we tend to overlook in our busy life. I now have a new perspective towards various aspects of life. Apart from this, I also learnt how to edit pictures and how different compositions can have a huge impact on the vibe of the subject of our photo.   
####All the photos are captured on Nikon D3400 and OnePlus 7.
